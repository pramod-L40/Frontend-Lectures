    100% wide until small breakpoint Responsive containers allow you to specify a class 
    that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher
     breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will 
     scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.
